/**
 * The support conversation's surfaces — a Plain thread as it renders in the
 * ticket pane, the workspace Conversation tab and the swipe deck.
 *
 * Every block here used to be drawn inside a hairline: a message, a note, an
 * attachment and each action all carried a box of their own, so a thread was
 * four nested outlines deep on a page whose only job is to be read.
 * `src/frontend/AGENTS.md` has the rule — a block sitting on its own fill is
 * already separated from the page, and an edge around it adds a second one. So
 * a message is a plate, a note takes the yellow wash the transcript already
 * gives a team note (lib/tinted-surface.ts), and the actions are the Button
 * primitive at its quiet weight.
 *
 * The two sides are deliberately not symmetrical, and a thread is read the way
 * a session transcript is. What you came here to read carries no surface at
 * all; your own half of the conversation is a bubble hugging the right edge.
 * Plating both sides put two facing walls of grey down the page and said who
 * spoke three times over — in the name, in the edge the message hugs, and
 * again in colour.
