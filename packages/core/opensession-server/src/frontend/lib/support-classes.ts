 * desktop shell, which is why the box is drawn even when it has nothing in it:
 * a bar that came and went with the open ticket would take the window's top
 * edge with it, and the pane below would jump by its height.
 *
 * Shared because two components fill it. The queue puts its name and count
 * here; the open ticket puts its subject and customer here (ConversationPane's
 * `headerInBar`), which is why that pane draws its own copy rather than being
 * handed one.
