/**
 * Async-state primitives — one language for "nothing here yet", "fetching"
 * and "that went wrong".
 *
 * These three states were saying the same thing four different ways: the
 * `.loading`/`.empty` classes (centred, faint, 40px of air), one-off inline
 * divs (`px-4 py-3 text-dim text-supporting`), the `.form-error` box, and
 * bespoke bordered panels. Same meaning, four appearances — so a surface
 * looked different depending on which one its author reached for.
 *
 * The shapes are unchanged; what's shared now is the vocabulary:
 *
 *  - `placement` decides the frame, not the meaning. A state that stands in
 *    for a whole region gets air and centring (`block`); one standing in for
 *    a card draws that card's surface (`card`); one living *inside* a card's
 *    row list just takes the row's padding and stays left-aligned (`row`), so
 *    it lines up with the rows it replaces instead of floating in the middle.
 *  - loading is the quietest register, and its mark follows the placement: a
 *    `block` stands in for a whole region and wears the larger waiting ring
 *    (`PageLoader`), while a `row` or `card` uses the smaller `Spinner`. Never
 *    the PixelSpinner, which means a model is generating,
 *    empty sits one step up (dim, with an optional title/icon/action when
 *    there's something to *do* about it), and alerts are the only state that
 *    gets a surface and a hue.
 *  - a mark is what waiting looks like when the shape ISN'T known. When it is,
 *    prefer a ghost (`Skeleton` and the shapes built on it): a label with a
 *    spinner says the app is busy, while rows in the shape of the rows that
 *    are coming say what is arriving and land it without moving the page.
 *
 * So `LoadingState` is for a thing WORKING — a probe, a sign-in being
 * prepared, a save — and a skeleton is for content ARRIVING. Reach for the
 * mark only when there is no shape to stand in for.
 *
 * `ui/notice.tsx` (ErrorNotice + its own LoadingState) is the earlier, partial
 * take on this; prefer these.

 * layout from the first paint: the height is reserved while the ghost is still
 * invisible, so real rows replace it in place instead of dropping the page
 * down as they land.
