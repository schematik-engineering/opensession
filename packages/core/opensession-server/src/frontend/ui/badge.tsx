/**
 * Badge — a label that reports state, not an action.
 *
 * This is the shape the app kept rebuilding: a dozen surfaces each wrote their
 * own `rounded-* px-1.5 py-0.5 text-meta` chip, and between them they used
 * three radii, four font weights, and six different ways of tinting the same
 * six states (`bg-yellow/15`, `bg-yellow-soft`, and a hand-written
 * `color-mix(… var(--yellow) 16% …)` all appeared for "warning"). Individually
 * each was defensible; together they made one concept look like six.
 *
 * The choices worth knowing:
 *
 *  - `text-meta`, always. A badge sits inside a row it must not outweigh, so
 *    it does not get its own type size or a bolder weight "because this one
 *    matters." The tone carries that.
 *  - `rounded-sm`, matching the majority of what it replaces. A capsule reads
 *    as a control you can press; a badge is not pressable, and the softer rect
 *    also stays concentric inside the `rounded-md`/`rounded-row` boxes these
 *    live in.
 *  - Tones name the *state*, not the colour. A call site asking for `success`
 *    keeps meaning success when the palette moves; one asking for `green`
 *    does not.
 *  - `soft` is the default because a page of outlined chips reads as a form
 *    (see the "do not frame a section in a border" rule in AGENTS.md).
 *    `outline` stays for the few places that sit ON a filled surface, where a
 *    soft fill has nothing to separate itself from.
 *
 * A badge that opens something is not a badge. Use `Button` with `size="sm"`.
