/**
 * Whose review request this row is carrying: their face, badged so it cannot
 * read as one of the presence faces further along the same row.
 *
 * The rail's blue dot says a review is waiting on you; this says who is
 * waiting, which is what decides whether you do it now. Same construction as
 * the mention badge beside it (a 16px face with a corner mark), in the blue
 * the app spends on "blocked on you" everywhere else.
 *
 * A GitHub request names the pull request's AUTHOR, because GitHub does not
 * record who added you as a reviewer — so the label says "opened by" there
 * and "asked you to review" only for a request made in Open Session, where
 * that is a fact rather than an inference.
