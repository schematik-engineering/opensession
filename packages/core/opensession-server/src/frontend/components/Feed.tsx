/**
 * What the team has been shipping.

 * The page is the feed. Its two filters stay together at the top: repo first,
 * then the team. Who shipped something is how you narrow the feed, not a
 * destination of its own. There is no per-person page to open, since
 * everything you would put on one already exists as their sidebar.
 *
 * So picking a teammate does two things at once, which is the point: it
 * narrows the feed to their merges, and it hands you their sidebar.
 *
 * The row is people, and only people. GitHub review teams used to sit at the
 * end of it, but a team is a routing rule for reviews rather than a group
 * whose work you would go and read. The sidebar's lens holds one person
 * anyway, so picking a team could not leave the sidebar anywhere sensible.
