 *
 * Three things live here: the transcript selection ("Selected text"), note
 * mode ("Team note") and ask mode ("Ask"). They are the same object as
 * far as a reader is concerned, *this composer is not in its ordinary state,
 * and here is what that state is*, so they share one shape rather than each
 * inventing a marker. That is also what keeps two tinted surfaces apart: the
 * wash says something is different, the chip says which, and no state paints
 * the box without naming itself here.
 *
 * The ✕ is optional, because it has to be honest. Ask mode's exit cuts a
 * worktree and only the server can say whether this session may promote at
 * all; where it cannot, the chip renders as a label with no ✕ rather than
 * offering an exit that does not exist.
