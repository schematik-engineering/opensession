/**
 * opensession-workflows — dynamic workflows: run a model-authored JS script

 * The script executes in a
 * contained Bun Worker (env-scrubbed, exfil/spawn globals stripped — see
 * workflow-worker.ts; exposure gating is the real boundary); each agent()
 * call becomes a plain pi run in ask mode, while mcp.* calls go through

 * ctx.mcpAllowlist/deniedTools this server was built with (see
 * src/server/workflow-types.ts for the contract, workflow-runner.ts for
 * orchestration). Interactive sessions, plus automations a HUMAN flagged
 * with `workflows: true` (automations.ts registers the instance per run —
 * e.g. the morning support digest, whose cron prompt is our own text).
 * Never set that flag on automations triggered by untrusted event/ticket
 * text (Plain triage, channel watches): model-authored code execution must
 * not be steerable from a ticket. The fail-closed gate in interactive-mcp.ts
 * still withholds the interactive builder from automation-owned sessions;
 * flagged automations only get the instance automations.ts explicitly
 * registers (human-authorized).

const RUN_WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE = `Run a dynamic workflow: a JS script YOU author that fans out many lightweight read/analyze agents deterministically and combines their results — map-reduce over a codebase, N-way file audits, comparative research. Progress streams live to this session's Agents panel; poll workflow_status for the outcome.

Script shape — plain JavaScript (NOT TypeScript), no imports; the API below is injected as globals. A meta export is required, then the async body follows (top-level await AND top-level return are allowed):

export const meta = {
  name: "route-audit",                              // required, short slug
  description: "Audit every route for auth checks", // optional
  phases: [{ title: "List" }, { title: "Audit" }],  // optional, pre-seeds the progress UI
};

Injected globals:
- agent(prompt, opts?) → Promise — run one focused agent (ask mode: reads files / runs read-only commands in this session's worktree; its final message is the return value). Resolves to the final text; with opts.schema (a JSON Schema) resolves to the parsed, validated object instead; resolves to null when the agent errored — filter with .filter(Boolean). opts: { label, phase, schema, model, effort, write }.
- parallel([...thunks]) → Promise — run zero-arg thunks concurrently and wait for all; a thrown thunk becomes null, never rejects the batch. E.g. await parallel(files.map(f => () => agent("Audit " + f)))
- pipeline(items, ...stages) → Promise — per-item stage chain with NO barrier between stages (item B can run stage 1 while item A is in stage 2). Each stage gets (prevResult, originalItem, index); a throwing stage drops that item to null and skips its remaining stages.
- mcp.<server>.<tool>(args) → Promise — call an MCP tool DIRECTLY from the script (no model turn: one round trip). Resolves to the tool's structured result, or its text auto-parsed as JSON when it parses. REJECTS on failure (unlike agent(), which resolves null) — try/catch it, or let parallel() degrade the throw to null. Also: mcp.call(server, tool, args) (same thing, dynamic names), mcp.servers() → string[], mcp.tools(server) → [{name, description, inputSchema}].
- phase(title) — set the current progress group for subsequent agent calls.
- log(message) — narrator line in the progress feed.
- args — your args_json, parsed, verbatim.
- budget — { total, spent(), remaining() } in output tokens.

AGENT OR TOOL? An agent() is a model turn — use it when the work needs judgement (reading code, summarizing, ranking, deciding). An mcp.* call is a function call — use it whenever you just need DATA from a connected server. Don't spend an agent on "query Prometheus for X" or "fetch that Linear issue": call the tool, filter the rows in the script, and spend agents only on the parts that need thinking. Tool names and argument shapes are the same ones in your own tool list; mcp.servers() / mcp.tools(server) enumerate them at runtime. The surface is exactly what YOUR runs may use (per-user restrictions apply, confirm-gated servers like stripe are never reachable from a script).

__MODEL_LINE__

EFFORT: pass opts.effort to set one agent's reasoning level. The values are low, medium, high, xhigh and max; each model offers its own ladder, and unset means that model's default. Spend it where judgement lives (a verifier, a ranker, a synthesis step); mechanical extraction and classification do not need it. A level the chosen model does not offer is ignored rather than an error.

Rules:
- Date.now(), argless new Date(), and Math.random() THROW inside scripts (they break resume replay determinism) — pass timestamps/seeds via args.
- Agents start fresh with ZERO context from this session — make every prompt self-contained (paths, constraints, what to return).
- Agents are read-only by default (ask mode). Pass opts.write to let one edit code (see below).
- Limits: ${WORKFLOW_LIMITS.maxConcurrentAgents} agents run concurrently (extras queue), ${WORKFLOW_LIMITS.maxAgents} agent() calls per run lifetime, ${Math.round(WORKFLOW_LIMITS.agentTimeoutMs / 60_000)}min per agent, ${Math.round(WORKFLOW_LIMITS.workflowTimeoutMs / 60_000)}min per workflow. mcp.* is cheaper and its own lane: ${WORKFLOW_LIMITS.maxConcurrentMcp} concurrent, ${WORKFLOW_LIMITS.maxMcpCalls} per run, ${Math.round(WORKFLOW_LIMITS.mcpCallTimeoutMs / 1000)}s per call.
- Both agent() and mcp.* calls are journaled, so resume_workflow REPLAYS them instead of re-firing — a resumed script won't create the same Linear issue twice.

Example (no opts.model set → agents run on the default):

export const meta = { name: "route-audit", phases: [{ title: "List" }, { title: "Audit" }, { title: "Rank" }] };
phase("List");
const files = await agent(
  "List every .ts file in packages/core/opensession-server/src/server/routes of this repo. Reply with ONLY the basenames.",
  { schema: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } } },
);
if (!files) return "listing failed";
phase("Audit");
const findings = await pipeline(
  files,
  (f) => agent("Read packages/core/opensession-server/src/server/routes/" + f + " and report missing auth/validation checks. Reply 'none' if clean.", { label: f }),
  (prev, f) => (prev && prev !== "none" ? f + ": " + prev : null),
);
log(findings.filter(Boolean).length + " files with findings");
phase("Rank");
const real = findings.filter(Boolean);
if (!real.length) return "all clean";
return await agent(
  "Rank these route-audit findings by real-world severity and drop the false positives:\\n" + real.join("\\n"),
  { label: "rank findings" },
);

Example of mixing tools and agents (data by tool, judgement by agent):

export const meta = { name: "alert-triage" };
const alerts = await mcp.grafana.list_alert_groups({ state: "new" });
const issues = await mcp.linear.list_issues({ team: "ENG", state: "started" });
// Reduce HERE — every row dropped in the script is a model turn not spent.
const unclaimed = alerts.filter((a) => !issues.some((i) => i.title.includes(a.title)));
log(unclaimed.length + " unclaimed of " + alerts.length);
return await parallel(
  unclaimed.map((a) => () => agent("Assess this alert and say who should own it: " + JSON.stringify(a), { label: a.id })),
);`;
